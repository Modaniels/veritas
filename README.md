üõ°Ô∏è Veritas: Digital Product Authentication System

Veritas (Latin for "Truth") is an enterprise-grade digital authentication and supply chain transparency platform that uses the power of the Hedera Network and NFT technology to give every physical product an unforgeable digital identity. Designed for high-value goods, particularly electronics, it relies on secure, embedded NFC tags for seamless, customer-friendly verification.

The Core Problem

The global economy is hampered by counterfeiting and an extreme lack of supply chain transparency. Traditional anti-counterfeiting measures are easily copied, and most digital systems are either too slow (traditional blockchain) or too expensive to scale to millions of mass-market products.

The Veritas Solution

Veritas provides a modern, fast, and scalable solution:
Problem Solved	Veritas Mechanism	Value Proposition
Counterfeiting	Each product receives a unique Non-Fungible Token (NFT) on the Hedera Network. This ID is tied to a secure, tamper-proof NFC tag.	Provides unforgeable proof of authenticity. A simple tap of a phone guarantees the item is genuine, protecting the brand and the consumer.
Lack of Trust	Every major event (minting, ownership transfer, verification) is recorded as a fast, low-cost transaction on the public ledger.	Establishes end-to-end transparency and verifiable provenance, proving where and when the product was made.
Poor UX/High Cost	Leverages Hedera's high speed and near-zero transaction fees, combined with Web3Auth for friction-free, email/social login.	Enables mass-market adoption by making the authentication process instant and intuitive (a simple tap), without requiring users to handle cryptocurrency or private keys.

üèóÔ∏è System Architecture & Components

The Veritas system is divided into three primary components:

1. Veritas Ledger Hub (B2B)

    Description: A secure web application (portal) for manufacturers.

    Function: Used to onboard new product lines, upload metadata, initiate the digital "minting" process (creating the NFT), and link the digital ID to the physical NFC tag serial number.

    Technology: [Placeholder: e.g., React/Next.js, Node.js API]

2. Veritas Scan (B2C)

    Description: The customer-facing mobile web application (launched via NFC tap).

    Function: Instantly reads the embedded NFC tag, queries the Hedera ledger for the corresponding NFT's status, displays product details, and allows the customer to claim digital ownership.

    Technology: [Placeholder: e.g., React Native / Vue.js, Web3Auth, Hedera JavaScript SDK]

3. Ledger & Smart Contracts

    Platform: Hedera Hashgraph (Used for its speed, finality, and low fees).

    Digital Asset: Hedera Token Service (HTS) NFTs (Each one representing a single, unique physical product).

    Storage: IPFS / Pinata (Used to permanently host the high-resolution, rich metadata files linked to the NFT).

    Identity: Web3Auth (Manages consumer key generation for seamless ownership transfer).

‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Veritas system locally.

Prerequisites

    Node.js (v18+)

    Docker & Docker Compose (for local database/IPFS simulation)

    Hedera Testnet Account ID and Private Key (for development)

1. Clone the Repository

Bash

git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
cd veritas-system

2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory and populate it with your Hedera credentials and service API keys:

# Hedera Testnet Configuration
HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID=[YOUR_TESTNET_ACCOUNT_ID]
HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY=[YOUR_TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY]
HEDERA_NETWORK=testnet

# Storage Service (e.g., Pinata)
IPFS_API_KEY=...
IPFS_SECRET_KEY=...

# Auth Service (Web3Auth)
WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID=...

3. Setup and Run the Hub (Manufacturer Portal)

Bash

cd veritas-ledger-hub
npm install
npm run dev
# The Manufacturer portal will be available at http://localhost:3000

4. Setup and Run the Scan App (Customer App)

Bash

cd veritas-scan-app
npm install
npm run dev
# The Customer app will be available at http://localhost:8080

5. Running Initial Smart Contract/Token Setup

Before running the applications, you must deploy the core logic and create the NFT Token Type on the network.
Bash

cd veritas-smart-contracts
npm install
# Execute the script to deploy the contract and mint the initial token supply
npm run deploy:setup
